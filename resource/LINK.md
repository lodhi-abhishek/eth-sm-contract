# Link the smart contract to Frontend

To link Ethereum with frontend, you need to use a JavaScript library that can interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. Some of the popular libraries are:

- `web3.js`: An Ethereum JavaScript API that connects using the generic JSON-RPC spec23. It provides complete functionality for all your Ethereum needs and allows you to create client-side wallets, send transactions, call smart contract functions and more4.

- `ethers.js`: An alternative to web3.js that aims to make it simpler and safer to write client-side JavaScript-based wallets4. It supports TypeScript, promises and events, and has a smaller bundle size than web3.js5.

- `create-eth-app`: A tool that helps you kickstart your dapp frontend development with React and Tailwind CSS. It comes with several optional integrations such as Etherscan, The Graph, OpenZeppelin and more5.
